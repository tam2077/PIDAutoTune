This repository is documentation for developing a program that can autotune PID values in a 3 dimensional highly dynamic system such as a drone.
This is a work in progress, not meant for any critical systems but as proof of concept.

Usage:
Clone the repo, install requirements.txt in a conda environment, and run your choice of training method from the controllers folder
This project requires pytorch
Install from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
